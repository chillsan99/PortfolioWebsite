                This form is a simple form build in HTML, CSS, and Javascript but will redirect to

                <p>This form allows users to give their username,
                what show or book they were recommending, to say how long the series is, the genre, as well 
                as the demographic of people who watch the show, or is targeted towards.

                    </div class>
                This is just a fan-page I made for the Anime/Manga Tokyo Revengers page, 
                but I will be adding more pages for characters, staff members, and possibly the live action adaptation. I am building with scratch without any sort of mock-up, and I am building this with HTML, and CSS, but will later implement Javascript as well.

                        <h3> Izumi Chan</h3>
                    </div>
                <p>Izumi-Chan is a personal project of mine that I want to create and put out onto the
                internet for other people to use. The purpose of this website is to give you the anime that you look up, 
                along with information about the show, such as the synopsis, and will also display a quote from a random 
                character of the show.
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>This project is being made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript and is my first time fully experimenting with APIs. 
                This website will be powered by two APIS, and that is Jikan, which is an anime database API that parses the website MyAnimeList to make the API. 
                Currently I am using the Version 3 of the website but will eventually move to level 4.
